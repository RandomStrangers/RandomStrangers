These are the current files for RandomStrangers.
RandomStrangers_Core is a form of RandomStrangers that renames all console references to RandomStrangers, and adds a custom instance of the previous console state.
NOTE: FOR RandomStrangers_Core YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD RandomStrangersCLI_Core AND RandomStrangers_CoreGUI AS WELL SINCE ALL CONSOLE STATES WILL BE CHANGED!
All versions come with TEN_BIT_BLOCKS built-in, so no infid dll will be provided.
